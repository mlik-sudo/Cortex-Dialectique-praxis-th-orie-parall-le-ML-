# Proposal to Rename Repository

**Title:** Proposition: renommage ASCII du repo en `cortex-dialectique-ml` (compat CLIs/URLs)

**Body:**

## Rationale

The current repository name, `Cortex-Dialectique-praxis-th-orie-parall-le-ML-`, contains special characters and is quite long. This can cause issues with:

*   **Command-line tools:** Many tools have difficulty parsing or handling repository names with special characters.
*   **URL encoding:** The name can become long and difficult to read when URL-encoded.
*   **General compatibility:** A simpler, ASCII-based name improves compatibility with a wider range of tools and platforms.

The proposed name, `cortex-dialectique-ml`, is a clean, ASCII-friendly version that preserves the core identity of the project while improving its technical compatibility.

## Action

This file serves as the content for an issue to formally propose renaming the repository.
