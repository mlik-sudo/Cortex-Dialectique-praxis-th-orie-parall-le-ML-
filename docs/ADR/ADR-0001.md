# ADR-0001: Multi-Driver Orchestrator

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We coordinate heterogeneous CLI agents with varying strengths and budgets. A central orchestrator must evaluate routing policies and budgets while maintaining local security controls.

## Decision
Adopt a multi-driver orchestrator that reads `project-space/policies/routing.yaml` and `project-space/policies/budgets.yaml`, resolves preferred drivers, and enforces fallback orderings. The orchestrator emits telemetry into the benchmarks harness and triggers security hooks before dispatching tasks.

## Consequences
- Enables future expansion to additional drivers without rewriting workflows.
- Requires consistent policy updates to prevent drift between theory and praxis.
- Establishes a single integration point for security scanning prior to execution.
